		<German>Dies ist eine Eigenschaft f&#252;r Kriegstreiber. Viele der eigenen Einheiten (tats&#228;chlich die besten Einheiten des Spiels: Nahkampf und Schieﬂpulver) erhalten eine Extra-Bef&#246;rderung und verbilligte Kasernen und Trockendocks sorgen f&#252;r zus&#228;tzliche Bef&#246;rderungen. Falls diese Eigenschaft nicht zum F&#252;hren von Kriegen verwendet wird, ist sie eigentlich komplett verschwendet.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronzeverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_IRON_WORKING]Eisenverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CIVIL_SERVICE]&#246;ffentliche Verwaltung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MACHINERY]Maschinen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_GUNPOWDER]Schieﬂpulver[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CHEMISTRY]Chemie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_RIFLING]Drall[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_STEEL]Stahl[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ASSEMBLY_LINE]Flieﬂband[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HEROIC_EPIC]Heldenepos[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WEST_POINT]West Point[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_RED_CROSS]Rotes Kreuz[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PENTAGON]Pentagon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STATUE_OF_ZEUS]Zeus-Statue[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Geb&#228;ude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Kaserne[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_DRYDOCK]Trockendock[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STABLE]Stallungen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vasallentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_NATIONHOOD]Nationale Selbstst&#228;ndigkeit[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_POLICE_STATE]Polizeistaat[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_STATE_PROPERTY]Staatseigentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzm&#246;glichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Wie diese Eigenschaft eingesetzt werden soll? Im Krieg, nat&#252;rlich. Immer noch nicht deutlich genug? Eine Horde Einheiten dazu benutzen, um andere Einheiten auszul&#246;schen.[NEWLINE]Die eigenen Streitkr&#228;fte sollten am besten aus Einheiten zusammengesetzt sein, die von der Eigenschaft profitieren: Nahkampfeinheiten (Krieger, Axtk&#228;mpfer, Schwertk&#228;mpfer, Speerk&#228;mpfer, Streitkolbentr&#228;ger, Pikeniere), Schieﬂpulvereinheiten (Musketiere, Sch&#252;tzen, Grenadiere, Infanterie, SAM Infanterie, Marines, Mechanisierte Infanterie) und die Spezialeinheiten, die sie jeweils ersetzen.[NEWLINE]Die Technologie Stahl sollte vordringlich erforscht werden, um Trockendocks errichten zu k&#246;nnen; ebenso verh&#228;lt es sich mit Technologien, die Voraussetzung f&#252;r die oben genannten Einheiten sind. Es sollte beachtet werden, dass einige der "aggressiven" Oberh&#228;upter &#252;ber eine Spezialeinheit verf&#252;gen, die von der Eigenschaft profitiert (Montezuma, Alexander, Tokugawa, Ragnar, Shaka), w&#228;hrend bei anderen dies nicht der Fall ist (Dschinghis Khan, Kublai Khan, Stalin). Trotzdem k&#246;nnen die letztgenannten nat&#252;rlich Nutzen aus den verbilligten Kasernen ziehen. Auﬂerdem sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass f&#252;r einen Krieg mehr als nur Nahkampf- und Schieﬂpulvereinheiten ben&#246;tigt werden - Belagerungswaffen und Berittene Einheiten erhalten vielleicht nicht die Extra-Bef&#246;rderung "Kampf I", sind aber trotzdem unverzichtbar.[NEWLINE]Das Weltwunder "Zeus-Statue" ist eine sch&#246;ne Erg&#228;nzung f&#252;r die eigene Zivilisation - haupts&#228;chlich deswegen, damit niemand anderes es errichten kann. Kriegsunzufriedenheit ist schon schlimm genug; wenn sie sich aber verdoppelt, hat das desastr&#246;se Auswirkungen auf die eigenen Welteroberungspl&#228;ne.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Die Eigenschaft "Aggressiv" selbst bietet keine wirtschaftlichen Vorteile und k&#246;nnte den Anreiz zu einem enormen Anwachsen der Kosten liefern. Schlieﬂlich verursacht jede Einheit laufende Kosten und diese Kosten erh&#246;hen sich, wenn die Einheit das eigene Hoheitsgebiet verl&#228;sst. Zus&#228;tzlich verursacht auch jede eroberte Stadt laufende Kosten. &#252;bertriebene Eroberungen, speziell in der Fr&#252;hphase einer Partie, k&#246;nnen ebenso t&#246;dlich sein, wie &#252;bertriebene Expansion.[NEWLINE]Andererseits: Da "Aggressiv" meist auch bessere Einheiten bedeuten sollte, werden hoffentlich auch weniger von ihnen ben&#246;tigt.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Charismatic was introduced with the Warlords expansion pack (along with Imperialistic and Protective) and is definitely the best of the three new traits. It is clearly a warmonger's trait, mainly because of the reduced XP requirement for each promotion. By warring early, you can amass a force of highly-promoted veteran units which you can keep upgrading as the game progresses.[PARAGRAPH:1]The extra happiness from the trait and two buildings also helps with warmongering, since it reduces war weariness. It should also help you financially; whether you run a CE or SE or a hybrid, more population because of an elevated happiness cap always means a stronger economy.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MYSTICISM]Mysticism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_AGRICULTURE]Agriculture[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ANIMAL_HUSBANDRY]Animal Husbandry[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_RADIO]Radio[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASS_MEDIA]Mass Media[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STONEHENGE]Stonehenge[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HEROIC_EPIC]Heroic Epic[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WEST_POINT]West Point[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_EIFFEL_TOWER]The Eiffel Tower[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PENTAGON]The Pentagon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MONUMENT]Monument[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Barracks[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STABLE]Stable[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_DRYDOCK]Drydock[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BROADCAST_TOWER]Broadcast Tower[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vassalage[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theocracy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]When you're Charismatic, go to war early to collect those promotions and build your army of veterans. Playing with barbs, even raging barbs, turned on allows you to amass more promotions faster, so you will likely have a powerful army by the time you've dealt with the barbarians and are ready to turn on your neighbours.[PARAGRAPH:1]Also be sure to take advantage of the elevated happiness cap. Prioritize growth in the early game: ensure each city has good food resources, bee-line to Pottery so you can build Granaries, and build Workers so you can ensure all your extra citizens have improved tiles to work. Chop Workers and Settlers as much as possible to hurry their builds and get your cities back to growing their populations.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mysticism and Mass Media are obvious tech targets in order to enable the happiness-increasing buildings (which are, unfortunately, not made cheaper by the trait; Charismatic is one of the few traits without a cheap building). Alternatively, you may bee-line to Radio and build the Eiffel Tower, which gives you a free broadcast tower in every one of your cities.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stonehenge is also an attractive wonder, since it gives you a free monument in each city. However, remember that those monuments magically disappear once you discover Calendar (Astronomy in BtS). Broadcast Towers and the Eiffel Tower, in contrast, never become obsolete. Also, any monument you build directly stays put to produce culture, and the culture doubles after 1000 years.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]As mentioned above, while Charismatic enhances the effects of two buildings, it has no cheap building, a limitation it shares only with the Financial and Imperialistic traits.[PARAGRAPH:1]Balancing early growth with the need to have a large number of Workers to ensure those extra citizens have improved tiles to work can be tricky. In addition to ensuring each city has at least one food resource, also try to ensure it has forests for chop-rushing Workers.</English>

		<German>Die Eigenschaft "Charismatisch" wurde mit dem ersten Addon "Warlords" ins Spiel eingef&#252;hrt (zusammen mit "Imperialistisch" und "Sch&#252;tzend") und ist sicherlich die n&#252;tzlichste der drei neuen Eigenschaften. Sie ist eindeutig f&#252;r Kriegstreiber gedacht, haupts&#228;chlich wegen der gesenkten Erfahrungspunkte-Anforderungen f&#252;r Bef&#246;rderungen. Indem schon fr&#252;h Kriege gef&#252;hrt werden, k&#246;nnen sehr viele erfahrene, mit Massen von Bef&#246;rderungen versehene Einheiten angesammelt werden, die im weiteren Spielverlauf noch weiter bef&#246;rdert werden k&#246;nnen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auch die zus&#228;tzliche Zufriedenheit dieser Eigenschaft und der zwei Geb&#228;ude unterst&#252;tzt das F&#252;hren von Kriegen, da sie die Kriegsunzufriedenheit senkt. Auﬂerdem unterst&#252;tzt sie auch die eigene Wirtschaft; sei es nun eine H&#252;ttenwirtschaft (CE), eine Spezialistenwirtschaft (SE) oder eine Mischung, eine h&#246;here Bev&#246;lkerung auf Grund einer erh&#246;hten Zufriedenheitsobergrenze bedeutet immer auch eine st&#228;rkere Wirtschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MYSTICISM]Mystik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_AGRICULTURE]Landwirtschaft[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_ANIMAL_HUSBANDRY]Tierzucht[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_RADIO]Funkwesen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASS_MEDIA]Massenmedien[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STONEHENGE]Stonehenge[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HEROIC_EPIC]Heldenepos[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WEST_POINT]West Point[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_EIFFEL_TOWER]Eiffelturm[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PENTAGON]Pentagon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Geb&#228;ude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MONUMENT]Monument[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Kaserne[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STABLE]Stallungen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_DRYDOCK]Trockendock[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BROADCAST_TOWER]Funkturm[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vasallentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzm&#246;glichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Mit einem Oberhaupt mit der Eigenschaft "Charismatisch" sollten fr&#252;h Kriege gef&#252;hrt werden, um Bef&#246;rderungen zu erlangen und eine Armee erfahrener Einheiten aufstellen zu k&#246;nnen. Falls die Option "Barbaren", oder sogar "Rasende Barbaren", aktiviert wurde, k&#246;nnen mehr Bef&#246;rderungen noch schneller angesammelt werden, so dass sehr wahrscheinlich nach der Ausrottung der Barbaren eine schlagkr&#228;ftige Armee zur Verf&#252;gung steht, die dann bereit ist, sich den Nachbarzivilisationen zuzuwenden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auﬂerdem sollte von der erh&#246;hten Zufriedenheitsobergrenze Gebrauch gemacht werden. Der Schwerpunkt sollte bereits fr&#252;h in der Partie auf Wachstum gelegt werden: es sollte sichergestellt werden, dass jede Stadt &#252;ber gute Nahrungsressourcen verf&#252;gt, die Forschung sollte geradewegs auf "Keramik" ausgerichtet werden, damit "Kornspeicher" errichtet werden k&#246;nnen, und Bautrupps sollten aufgestellt werden, damit diese  f&#252;r die Modernisierung der Stadtgel&#228;ndefelder sorgen k&#246;nnen, die dann von den zus&#228;tzlichen B&#252;rgern bearbeitet werden k&#246;nnen. Bautrupps und Siedler sollten wenn m&#246;glich durch das Abholzen von W&#228;ldern beschleunigt werden, damit die St&#228;dte schneller wachsen k&#246;nnen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mystik" und "Massenmedien" stellen offensichtliche Forschungsziele dar, um die Geb&#228;ude verf&#252;gbar zu machen, die zur Erh&#246;hung der Zufriedenheit beitragen (die durch die Eigenschaft leider nicht verbilligt werden; "Charismatisch" ist eine der wenigen Eigenschaften ohne verbilligtes Geb&#228;ude). Wahlweise kann auch das "Funkwesen" erforscht werden und der "Eiffelturm" errichtet werden, der einen kostenlosen "Funkturm" in jeder eigenen Stadt gew&#228;hrt.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Stonehenge" ist ebenfalls ein attraktives Wunder, da es ein kostenloses "Monument" in jeder Stadt gew&#228;hrt. Jedoch sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass diese Monumente magischerweise verschwinden, wenn "Kalender" erfoscht wurde ("Astronomie" in BtS). Im Gegensatz dazu veralten Funkt&#252;rme und der Eiffelturm niemals. Auﬂerdem verbleibt jedes selbst errichtete Monument in einer Stadt und generiert Kulturpunkte, die sich nach 1000 Jahren sogar verdoppeln.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Wie oben erw&#228;hnt, erh&#246;ht die Eigenschaft "Charismatisch" zwar den Effekt zweier Geb&#228;ude, verf&#252;gt aber selbst &#252;ber kein verbilligtes Geb&#228;ude, was eine Beschr&#228;nkung ist, die sie nur mit den Eigenschaften "Finanzorientiert" und "Imperialistisch" teilt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Es kann etwas schwierig sein, das fr&#252;he Wachstum mit der Notwendigkeit zu vereinen, viele Bautrupps aufstellen zu m&#252;ssen, die sicherstellen, dass die zus&#228;tzlichen B&#252;rger modernisierte Gel&#228;ndefelder bearbeiten k&#246;nnen. Zus&#228;tzlich muss jede Stadt mit mindestens einer Nahrungsressource versorgt sein und sollte auﬂerdem in der N&#228;he von W&#228;ldern gelegen sein, damit die Aufstellung von Bautrupps beschleunigt werden kann.</German>

		<German>Die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" ist vor allem in der fr&#252;hen Phase einer Partie sehr n&#252;tzlich, da sie die schnelle Erweiterung der eigenen Grenzen und damit die Inbesitznahme von neuen Gebieten und Ressourcen erlaubt. Der Patch 2.08 f&#252;r das erste Addon "Warlords" f&#252;gte der Eigenschaft verbilligte Bibliotheken hinzu, die zu den besten Geb&#228;uden des Spiels z&#228;hlen, wodurch die Eigenschaft noch weiter aufgewertet wurde.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_WRITING]Schrift[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DRAMA]Drama[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CONSTRUCTION]Bauwesen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]keine[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Geb&#228;ude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Bibliothek[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_THEATRE]Theater[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSEUM]Kolosseum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Meinungsfreiheit[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzm&#246;glichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Der groﬂe Vorteil der Eigenschaft "Kreativ" besteht darin, dass mehr Freiheiten bei der Gr&#252;ndung einer Stadt und deren ersten Bauprojekten bestehen. Bei der Gr&#252;ndung einer Stadt muss nicht unbedingt darauf geachtet werden, dass sich eine wichtige Ressource im ersten Stadtfeldring befindet, damit sie sofort zug&#228;nglich ist; schon wenige Runden nach Gr&#252;ndung der Stadt steht sie zur Verf&#252;gung. Auﬂerdem k&#246;nnen Monumente, Stonehenge und die Verbreitung einer Religion auﬂer Acht gelassen werden (nun, die letztere Aufgabe kann zumindest etwas entspannter angegangen werden).[PARAGRAPH:1]Zus&#228;tzlich kann die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" dabei helfen, schon fr&#252;h in einer Partie das Tauziehen mit anderen Zivilisationen um Schl&#252;sselgel&#228;ndefelder, die mit wichtigen Ressourcen versehen sind, zu gewinnen. Ebenso kann die Eigenschaft, falls die Karte es erlaubt, dazu verwendet werden, um das Gebiet um einen Engpass abzuriegeln. "Kreativ" ist eher eine defensive Eigenschaft, nah verwandt mit der Eigenschaft "Sch&#252;tzend". Durch die fr&#252;he Erweiterung der eigenen Grenzen und die Belegung der Gel&#228;ndefelder mit der eigenen Kultur muss sich ein Gegner durch ein groﬂes Gebiet qu&#228;len, bevor er angreifen kann. Auﬂerdem wird es f&#252;r andere Zivilisationen schwieriger, Gel&#228;ndefelder durch die Gr&#252;ndung von St&#228;dten oder deren Eroberung f&#252;r sich zu gewinnen. Durch die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" erh&#246;ht sich der kulturelle Widerstand einer Stadt schneller, wodurch sie schwerer zu erobern ist.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Technologie "Schrift" schaltet die verbilligten Bibliotheken frei, so dass diese Technologie offensichtlich sogar noch wichtiger ist als zuvor. Die verbilligten Theater und Kolosseen k&#246;nnen, abh&#228;ngig von der eigenen Strategie und den Umst&#228;nden der Partie, hilfreich sein oder auch nicht. Im mittleren bis sp&#228;ten Spielverlauf sollte ein Krieg gef&#252;hrt werden, um den gr&#246;ﬂten Nutzen aus diesen Geb&#228;uden ziehen zu k&#246;nnen, indem sie zur Verringerung der Kriegsunzufriedenheit eingesetzt werden.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]"Kreativ" ist eine Eigenschaft, die in der fr&#252;hen Phase einer Partie sehr n&#252;tzlich ist und w&#228;hrend des weiteren Spielverlaufs seinen Nutzen verliert. Die zus&#228;tzlichen +2[ICON_CULTURE] werden immer weniger entscheidend w&#228;hrend die Partie fortschreitet und sich in jeder Stadt mehr M&#246;glichkeiten zur Generierung von Kulturpunkten ergeben. Auﬂerdem sind die verbilligten Geb&#228;ude schon fr&#252;h in einer Partie verf&#252;gbar und daher gleich zu Anfang relativ g&#252;nstig, so dass deren schnellere Produktionszeiten sp&#228;ter in der Partie weniger von Vorteil sind. In der Mitte der meisten Partien spielt die Eigenschaft "Kreativ" fast keine Rolle mehr.</German>

The Warlords 2.08 patch added cheap Libraries, one of the best buildings in the game, making this trait even better.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_WRITING]Writing[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DRAMA]Drama[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CONSTRUCTION]Construction[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]n/a[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_THEATRE]Theatre[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSEUM]Colosseum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Free Speech[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The big benefit Creative provides is allowing you more freedom in your city placement and in your early city builds. You don't have to worry about placing a city so a crucial resource is in its first ring of workable tiles so you can access it right away; it will be workable within a few short turns of founding the city. You can also skip monuments, Stonehenge, and spreading a religion (well, you can be a little more relaxed about the latter, at least).[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, Creative may allow you to win some early game tug-o-war battles with a nearby civ over a key resource tile. By the same token, if the map lends itself to it, you can use the trait to seal off territory at a choke point. Creative is also something of a defensive trait, a cousin to Protective. By expanding your borders earlier and infusing the tiles with your culture, you have more territory that the enemy has to trudge through to attack you. It's also harder for another civilization to take tiles from you by city placement or by conquering cities. Creative also raises the cultural defense of a city faster, making it tougher to conquer.[PARAGRAPH:1]Writing enables the trait's cheap libraries, so it's obviously an even more important tech than before. The cheap theatres and coliseums may or may not be useful, depending on your strategy and circumstances in the game. You may want to warmonger in the mid or late game to get your most out of these buildings, using them to decrease war weariness.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Creative is a trait that is extremely useful in the early game and gets weaker as the game goes on. The +2[ICON_CULTURE] becomes less and less of a factor as the game progresses and more methods of producing culture accrue in each city. Also, the cheap buildings are available early and are all relatively cheap to begin with, so their faster production times will be less noticeable later in the game. By the middle of most games, the Creative trait is mostly a non-factor.</Spanish>

		<German>Die Eigenschaft "Expansiv" sieht auf den ersten Blick nicht besonders interessant aus. Tats&#228;chlich scheint sie, in die Kategorie der "schwachen" Eigenschaften zu geh&#246;ren, wie beispielsweise "Sch&#252;tzend". Immerhin ist Gesundheit kein groﬂes Problem, schlieﬂlich ist es die Zufriedenheit, die fr&#252;h in einer Partie das eigene Wachstum hemmt. Und sobald diese kr&#228;nklichen gr&#252;nen Ranken, die um die eigenen St&#228;dte schweben, zur Normalit&#228;t geworden sind, wird klar, dass ihre Auswirkungen in der Regel nicht so schlimm sind. Probleme mit der Gesundheit einer Stadt verlangsamen das Wachstum nur ein wenig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aber abwarten. Kornspeicher, die f&#252;r Oberh&#228;upter mit der Eigenschaft "Expansiv" relativ g&#252;nstig sind, sind eines der n&#252;tzlichsten Geb&#228;ude im Spiel. Falls eine Getreide-Ressource verf&#252;gbar ist, erzeugen sie zus&#228;tzliche Gesundheit. Aber, was noch wichtiger ist, sie erm&#246;glichen den wirksamen Einsatz der Staatsform "Sklaverei", da geopferte B&#252;rger schneller "nachwachsen".[PARAGRAPH:1]Und mit dem Patch 2.08 f&#252;r das erste Addon "Warlords" erhielt die Eigenschaft "Expansiv" eine dringend n&#246;tige Verst&#228;rkung durch leicht verbilligte Bautrupps. Es ist immer besser, mehr Bautrupps einsetzen zu k&#246;nnen, besonders in der fr&#252;hen Phase einer Partie.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Keramik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_COMPASS]Kompass[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronzeverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HANGING_GARDEN]H&#228;ngende G&#228;rten[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_NOTRE_DAME]Notre-Dame[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Geb&#228;ude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GRANARY]Kornspeicher[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_HARBOR]Hafen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_SLAVERY]Sklaverei[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzm&#246;glichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Das erste Forschungziel sollte "Keramik" sein. Auﬂerdem sollten die verbilligten Kornspeicher errichtet werden (oder deren Produktion durch Zwangsarbeit beschleunigt werden). Die Produktion sollte immer durch Zwangsarbeit beschleunigt werden und zwar, wenn m&#246;glich, w&#228;hrend der gesamten Partie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Daher ist es wichtig, sich dar&#252;ber zu informieren, wie die Staatsform "Sklaverei" am wirksamsten eingesetzt wird, um den Produktions&#252;berschuss der Zwangsarbeit zu maximieren und somit sowohl das derzeitige Bauprojekt als auch das folgende schneller fertigstellen zu k&#246;nnen. Dank dem Kornspeicher, wird die Bev&#246;lkerung schneller nachwachsen, wodurch der erneute Einsatz der Zwangsarbeit erm&#246;glicht wird.[PARAGRAPH:1]Offensichtlich sollten auch mehr Bautrupps aufgestellt und eingesetzt werden, da sie ebenfalls verbilligt verf&#252;gbar sind. Eigene Gel&#228;ndefelder sollten so schnell wie m&#246;glich mit Modernisierungen ausgestattet und Ressourcen erschlossen werden. Dabei sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass die 25% h&#246;here Produktionsgeschwindigkeit f&#252;r Bautrupps von der Produktionsleistung abh&#228;ngt und nicht von der Nahrungsproduktion, so dass einige Gel&#228;ndefelder mit produktionsf&#246;rdernden Modernisierungen ausgestattet und diese auch w&#228;hrend der Produktion eines Bautrupps bearbeitet werden sollten. Da H&#228;fen ebenfalls verbilligt sind, sollte versucht werden, einige K&#252;stenst&#228;dte zu erlangen, so dass der Vorteil dieses Geb&#228;udes auch genutzt werden kann.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auﬂerdem sollte nach M&#246;glichkeiten Ausschau gehalten werden, um die zus&#228;tzlichen +2 Gesundheit wirksam einsetzen zu k&#246;nnen. Beispielsweise kann schon fr&#252;h eine Stadt mitten im Dschungel oder im Schwemmland platziert werden. Zus&#228;tzlich k&#246;nnen gesundheitsvermindernde Geb&#228;ude wie Schmieden und Fabriken errichtet werden, ohne deren Einfluss auf die Gesundheit einer Stadt ber&#252;cksichtigen zu m&#252;ssen. Es k&#246;nnen auch mehr W&#228;lder abgeholzt werden, da deren Gesundheitsboni nicht ben&#246;tigt (deswegen sind die Technologien "Bronzeverarbeitung" und "Mathematik" so interessant). Allerdings macht die Eigenschaft "Expansiv" die eigenen St&#228;dte nicht unbesiegbar, die Besch&#228;ftigung mit der Gesundheit der eigenen St&#228;dte wird nur weiter nach hinten verschoben als sonst &#252;blich.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die "H&#228;ngende G&#228;rten" sind ein interessantes Weltwunder f&#252;r diese Eigenschaft. Auf den ersten Blick erscheint dies nicht so: Ein Gesundheitsbonus ist schon vorhanden. Warum sollte ein zus&#228;tzlicher ben&#246;tigt werden? Weil mit dieser Eigenschaft eine Strategie verfolgt wird, die die Gesundheit der eigenen St&#228;dte bis zum &#228;uﬂersten treibt, deshalb. Es sollten bevorzugt Wunder und Geb&#228;ude errichtet werden, die die Vorteile einer Eigenschaft noch weiter erh&#246;hen (deshalb kann beispielsweise bei einem Oberhaupt mit der Eigenschaft "Philosophisch" versucht werden, das "Parthenon" zu errichten). Die "H&#228;ngende G&#228;rten" erh&#246;hen auﬂerdem die Bev&#246;lkerungszahl, die wiederum f&#252;r Zwangsarbeit eingesetzt werden k&#246;nnen. Und gew&#228;hren noch Groﬂe Pers&#246;nlichkeit-Punkte f&#252;r einen Groﬂen Ingenieur! Das ist groﬂartig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Weltwunder "Notre-Dame" kann ebenfalls n&#252;tzlich sein. Bei wiederholtem Einsatz der Zwangsarbeit, kann der Zufriedenheitsbonus dieser groﬂen Kathedrale tats&#228;chlich sehr angenehm sein.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Wie bei vielen andere Eigenschaften, beispielsweise "Kreativ", lassen die Vorteile der Eigenschaft "Expansiv" im Verlauf einer Partie nach. Andere Methoden, um die Gesundheit zu erh&#246;hen, werden verf&#252;gbar, die verbilligten Geb&#228;ude sind nur in der fr&#252;hen Phase einer Partie von Vorteil und sobald das eigene Schienennetz gegen Ende einer Partie vollendet ist, werden die Massen von billigen Bautrupps nutzlos. Auﬂerdem k&#246;nnte der Wunsch aufkommen, von der "Sklaverei" zu einer anderen Staatsform zu wechseln, wodurch einer der Hauptvorteile der verbilligten Kornspeicher verloren ginge.[PARAGRAPH:1]Und wie viele andere Eigenschaften gew&#228;hrt "Expansiv" keine direkten wirtschaftlichen Vorteile.</German>

		<English>[TAB]This is quite probably the strongest of the traits, at least at levels below Emperor, so much so that many players consider Financial to be a "crutch" and avoid leaders with this trait because they feel it offers an unfair advantage. The game developers apparently agreed, hence in one of the early patches they removed the double production speed of banks to lessen its power. Even so, Financial remains a truly awesome trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]At first, it seems so subtle: +1[ICON_COMMERCE] on some tiles? So what?[PARAGRAPH:1]The answer, of course, is this: It's the economy, stupid. Say what you want about military, research, religion, and other game elements; ultimately, your civilization requires a robust economy in order to support everything else you do. Military units incur maintenance costs, more so if they're outside of your territory.

		<German>Dies ist vermutlich die m&#228;chtigste Eigenschaft, zumindest in den Schwierigkeitsgraden unterhalb von "Kaiser".  Das geht so weit, dass viele Spieler "Finanzorientiert" als "Kr&#252;cke" ansehen und Oberh&#228;upter mit dieser Eigenschaft meiden, da sie ihrer Meinung nach einen unfairen Vorteil darstellt. Die Spieleentwickler sahen das offensichtlich genauso. Denn sie haben in einem fr&#252;hen Patch die doppelte Produktionsgeschwindigkeiten von Banken entfernt und die Eigenschaft damit geschw&#228;cht. Trotzdem bleibt "Finanzorientiert" eine fantastische Eigenschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auf den ersten Blick sieht es so bescheiden aus: +1[ICON_COMMERCE] auf einigen Gel&#228;ndefeldern? Na und?[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Antwort ist nat&#252;rlich folgende: Es geht um die Wirtschaft. &#252;ber Milit&#228;r, Forschung, Religion und andere Spielelemente kann viel gesagt werden; letztlich ben&#246;tigt eine Zivilisation eine stabile Wirtschaft, um alles andere zu erm&#246;glichen. Milit&#228;reinheiten verursachen Unterhaltskosten, noch h&#246;here auﬂerhalb des eigenen Territoriums. St&#228;dte verursachen ebenfalls Unterhaltskosten, die das Wachstum bremsen und es erforderlich machen, dass sich jede Stadt irgendwie selbst tragen kann. Und um in der Technologie mithalten zu k&#246;nnen, m&#252;ssen Mittel beiseite gelegt werden, um die Forschung zu unterst&#252;tzen. Die Eigenschaft "Finanzorientiert" macht all diese Aufgaben etwas einfacher - bei richtiger Anwendung sogar viel einfacher.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Keramik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CURRENCY]W&#228;hrung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_GUILDS]Gilden[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BANKING]Bankwesen[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_LIBERALISM]Liberalismus[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PRINTING_PRESS]Druckerpresse[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DEMOCRACY]Demokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CORPORATION]Kapitalgesellschaft[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSUS]Koloss[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WALL_STREET]Wall Street[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Geb&#228;ude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MARKET]Markt[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GROCER]Kr&#228;mer[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BANK]Bank[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Bibliothek[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_UNIVERSITY]Universit&#228;t[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_OBSERVATORY]Observatorium[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LABORATORY]Labor[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Meinungsfreiheit[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_EMANCIPATION]Emanzipation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzm&#246;glichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Es ist recht unkompliziert die Eigenschaft "Finanzorientiert" zum eigenen Vorteil zu nutzen und zwar mit der H&#252;ttenschwemme (engl.: cottage spam). Ja, die altbew&#228;hrte H&#252;ttenwirtschaft (engl.: cottage economy, oder kurz CE). Dazu m&#252;ssen [LINK=UNIT_WORKER]Bautrupps[\LINK] so viele [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE]H&#252;tten[\LINK] errichten, wie die eigene Bev&#246;lkerung bewirtschaften kann, w&#228;hrend diese gleichzeitig auch andere wertvolle Gel&#228;ndefelder bewirtschaftet. Am wirkungsvollsten werden H&#252;tten auf Grasland neben Fl&#252;ssen platziert, da der Vorteil von "Finanzorientiert" einsetzt, sobald die H&#252;tte erichtet ist, w&#228;hrend die 2 Nahrungseinheiten den B&#252;rger ern&#228;hrt, der das Feld bewirtschaftet (Schwemmland mit 3 Nahrungseinheiten ist noch besser f&#252;r H&#252;tten geeignet, da es neben der Wirtschaft auch das Stadtwachstum unterst&#252;tzt). Allerdings sollte bedacht werden, dass stattdessen einige Gel&#228;ndefelder durch den Bau von Bauernh&#246;fen bew&#228;ssert werden m&#252;ssen, um die eigene Bev&#246;lkerung zu ern&#228;hren und zu vermehren und/oder um die Bew&#228;sserung von entfernten Gel&#228;ndefelder zu erm&#246;glichen. Es sollte sichergestellt werden, dass die H&#252;tten stets bewirtschaftet werden, da sie sich nur dann weiterentwickeln und die Ertr&#228;ge erh&#246;hen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auﬂerdem sollte auch auf die Erschlieﬂung von Ressourcen geachtet werden, die zus&#228;tzliche Wirtschaftsertr&#228;ge generieren. Edelsteine, Gold und Silber sind offensichtliche Ziele, aber Gew&#252;rze, Seide und Wein sind ebenso n&#252;tzlich; sie alle erbringen +1[ICON_COMMERCE] zus&#228;tzlich zum Handelsertrag der Ressource. Es sollte sichergestellt werden, dass diese Ressourcen sich in einem Stadtkreuz befinden, von einem Bautrupp erschlossen und dann bewirtschaftet werden. Die meisten Ressourcen mit erh&#246;hten Wirtschaftsertr&#228;gen steigern auch die Zufriedenheit der B&#252;rger, wodurch die eigenen St&#228;dte st&#228;rker wachsen k&#246;nnen, die so wiederum mehr H&#252;tten und weitere Gel&#228;ndefelder mit Wirtschaftsboni bewirtschaften k&#246;nnen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mit all diesen zus&#228;tzlichen Wirtschaftsertr&#228;gen sollte vor allem der Bau von Geb&#228;uden, die mit diesen etwas anfangen k&#246;nnen, sowie die Technologien gef&#246;rdert werden, die diese Geb&#228;ude erm&#246;glichen. Bibliotheken, Kl&#246;ster, Universit&#228;ten, Observatorien und Labore vervielf&#228;ltigen die Menge der Forschungsertr&#228;ge, die aus den Wirtschaftsertr&#228;gen &#252;ber die Einstellung des Forschungsanteils konvertiert werden, w&#228;hrend M&#228;rkte, Kr&#228;mer und Banken das verbliebene Gold vermehren. Zus&#228;tzlich erh&#246;ht die Erforschung der Technologie "Druckerpresse" und die Staatsform "Meinungsfreiheit" die Ertr&#228;ge der H&#252;tten. Mit Hilfe der Staatsform "Emanzipation" entwickeln sich die H&#252;tten schneller.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Zun&#228;chst bewirkt "Finanzorintiert" bei Gel&#228;ndefeldern mit weniger als 2 Wirtschaftsertr&#228;gen keine direkte Verbesserung. Dadurch ergibt sich automatisch eine gewisser Widerwillen, solche Gel&#228;ndefelder zu bearbeiten, auch wenn es n&#246;tig ist. Das bedeutet, dass eine Produktionsstadt, die haupts&#228;chlich Produktionsertr&#228;ge statt Wirtschaftsertr&#228;ge generiert, keinen direkten Nutzen von dieser Eigenschaft bezieht. Trotzdem wird mindestens eine Produktionsstadt ben&#246;tigt, aber besser mehrere. Deshalb sollten diese nicht zugunsten von Finanzst&#228;dten vernachl&#228;ssigt werden. Gleiches gilt f&#252;r die Verbesserung von Gel&#228;ndefeldern. Ja, man kann eine H&#252;tte auf einem H&#252;gel mit Grasland errichten, aber sollte man auch? Eine Mine w&#252;rde die dringend ben&#246;tigten Produktionsertr&#228;ge generieren, an denen es Finanzst&#228;dten typischerweise mangelt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das gr&#246;ﬂte Problem der Eigenschaft "Finanzorientiert" ist jedoch die Verletzlichkeit der Wirtschaft, insbesondere sp&#228;ter in einer Partie. Eine H&#252;tte ben&#246;tigt viele Runden, damit sie zu einer Gemeinde w&#228;chst, aber diese Investition kann durch ein paar pl&#252;ndernde feindliche Einheiten schnell zunichte gemacht werden. Und der nicht zu verachtende Goldertrag beim Pl&#252;ndern von H&#252;tten ist f&#252;r Gegenspieler sehr verlockend. Daher m&#252;ssen die besten, &#228;ltesten Finanzst&#228;dte mit Einheiten gesichert werden, die Pl&#252;nderungen verhindern k&#246;nnen, wenn ein Krieg beginnt. Zudem sollte darauf geachtet werden, die besten Finanzst&#228;dte im Herzen des eigenen Reiches anzusiedeln und nicht an den gef&#228;hrdeten Grenzen oder K&#252;sten.</German>

Most of the commerce-rich resources also increase happiness, which means you can grow your other cities larger and, in turn, work more cottages and other commerce-rich tiles.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you'll have all that extra commerce rolling in, prioritize buildings that do something with it, and the technologies that enable them. Libraries, monasteries, universities, observatories, and laboratories all multiply the amount of research you convert from commerce via the science slider, while markets, grocers, and banks multiply whatever gold is left over. In addition, Printing Press will increase the yield from your cottage investment, as will the Free Speech civic. Emancipation will make any immature cottages grow faster.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]First off, Financial provides no direct benefit to a tile that isn't providing at least 2 commerce. This can make you reluctant to work tiles without the benefit, even though you will need to. This means a production city, which mostly works hammer-rich rather than commerce-rich tiles, gains no direct benefit from the trait. You will, however, need at least one production city, preferably more, so don't overlook them in favour of commerce cities. The same goes for tile improvements. Yes, you can place a cottage on a grassland hill. But should you? A mine would provide much-needed hammers, something commerce cities often chronically lack.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest problem with Financial, however, is the vulnerability of your economy, especially as time goes on. It takes a lot of turns to make a cottage grow into a town, but that investment can be quickly undone by a couple of pillaging enemy units. And the not-inconsiderable amount of gold to be gained from pillaging cottages is very tempting to the AI. You will need to garrison your best, oldest commerce cities with anti-pillaging units if you go to war. Also try to have your best commerce cities inland at the heart of your empire, rather than on the more vulnerable borders or coastline.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]After several off-line games as Julius Caesar, my opinion of this trait has improved. I originally included it in the "Weak" category, but now feel it belongs in "Medium"--if it's used properly.[PARAGRAPH:1]Imperialistic supports aggressive expansion in two ways.

This especially suits Catherine the Great of Russia, since her Creative trait has definite synergy with an early game land-grabbing strategy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Keep in mind that the increased Settler production comes from hammers, not food. This means you'll want to focus as much on mines as farms and pastures when improving tiles in the early game. Chopping and whipping contribute hammers, so those get multiplied by the trait as well--hence the attraction of Bronze Working and Mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:1]You can enhance the increased GG emergence further by building the Great Wall. In addition to keeping barbs away, that wonder also provides +100% Great General emergence from battles that take place within your cultural borders, resulting in a +200% GG boost with the trait when defending within your own territory. Masonry, therefore, and a source of stone are likely to be priorities when playing as a leader with this trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The chief way to take advantage of the Imperialistic trait once the original period of REX is over is simple: war. War early and war often. It's the only way to generate Great Generals (and remember that battling barbs earns you XPs, but not points towards a Great General.) Great Generals are actually one of the most useful Great People in the game, even if they lack some of the uses of other GPs (such as lightbulbing technologies or starting a Golden Age). You can attach them to units to uber-promote them, put them in cities to provide additional XPs or boost unit production with a military academy. Just remember to prioritize Code of Laws and courthouses to keep your ever-expanding empire economically viable.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many players favour combining the first Great General with a unit and giving it the Medic I, II, and III promotions. This medic unit will heal your stacks faster, allowing them to return to the fray much sooner. You can also use a GG to give a unit the Leadership promotion, which creates synergy with the Imperialistic trait because the promotion results in double XPs for that unit from every battle it survives, and those double XPs are doubled again in their count towards your next Great General. You can also combine the GG with a Caravel to give it Flanking I, Navigtion I, and Navigation II in order to practically guarantee winning the circumnavigation bonus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you're going after several Great Generals (and likely basing much of your strategy on their benefits), you'll want to snag the free one that you get from researching Fascism first. With all the warmongering you'll be doing, you're going to want to build Mount Rushmore and run Police State to alleviate some of the War Weariness anyway.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Well, for starters, there's no cheap building and no economic advantage. It seems logical that Imperialistic should have cheap courthouses, but Organized has those, and shifting them away would seriously weaken that trait. Perhaps jails would have been a good cheap building for Imperialistic. If Civ IV had useful forts, faster build times of those would have been logical for this trait as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Instead of a cheap building, however, there's a cheap unit. But Imperialistic's boost to Settler builds comes from hammers, not food. This means you need to work at cross-purposes in the early game, building mines to ensure your Settler builds take advantage of the trait. If food also boosted the Setter's build time, this would be a much stronger trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest weakness of the trait, however, is that it locks you into a specific strategy. You don't have to play as a warmonger with the Aggressive trait; you could leverage it to build a strong army and military infrastructure (the cheap barracks and drydocks count towards your power rating, after all) so you're left alone to build. With Imperialistic, however, you have to warmonger. There's no other way to earn those Great Generals except by fighting other civs. Don't play with this trait unless you're in the mood to knock heads, or you're wasting it.</English>

		<German>Nach einigen Einzelspielerpartien mit Julius C&#228;sar wandelt sich die Meinung vieler Spieler zu dieser Eigenschaft normalerweise. Urspr&#252;nglich w&#252;rde man sie als schwach einstufen, doch sp&#228;testens danach sollte sie eher unter den mittelstarken Eigenschaften eingeordnet werden - falls sie richtig eingesetzt wird.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Imperialistisch" unterst&#252;tzt eine agressive Expansion in zweifacher Weise. Erstens sind Siedler kosteng&#252;nstiger zu produzieren, wodurch schon fr&#252;h in einer Partie schnell sehr viel Land besetzt werden kann. Zweitens wird man dazu ermutigt, durch Kriege zu expandieren, um von der gr&#246;ﬂeren Wahrscheinlichkeit des Erscheinens eines Groﬂen Generals zu profitieren.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Wichtige Technologien[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BRONZE_WORKING]Bronzeverarbeitung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MASONRY]Steinmetzkunst[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_MATHEMATICS]Mathematik[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Gesetzgebung[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_FASCISM]Faschismus[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Alle milit&#228;rischen Technologien[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Wunder[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_WALL]Groﬂe Mauer[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_MT_RUSHMORE]Mount Rushmore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Bevorzugte Geb&#228;ude[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_BARRACKS]Kaserne[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]N&#252;tzliche Staatsformen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_VASSALAGE]Vasallentum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_THEOCRACY]Theokratie[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_POLICE_STATE]Polizeistaat[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Einsatzm&#246;glichkeiten[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Offensichtlich sollte in der Fr&#252;hphase einer Partie eine Strategie der schnellen Expansion (engl. REX = Rapid EXpansion) verfolgt werden, die von einer aggressiven und kriegerischen Expansionspolitik gefolgt wird, sobald die Kernst&#228;dte entsprechend ausgebaut worden sind. Das passt am besten zu Katharina der Groﬂen (Russland), da ihre Eigenschaft "Kreativ" eindeutig Synergien mit einer Strategie der fr&#252;hen Landnahme f&#246;rdert.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dabei sollte bedacht werden, dass die beschleunigte Siedlerproduktion durch H&#228;mmer erfolgt, nicht durch Nahrung. Das bedeutet, dass bereits in der Fr&#252;hphase einer Partie die Errichtung von Minen genauso wichtig ist, wie jene von Feldern und Weiden. Das Roden von W&#228;ldern und Opfern von Bev&#246;lkerung produzieren ebenfalls H&#228;mmer, die durch die Eigenschaft multipliziert werden - deshalb sind Bronzeverarbeitung und Mathematik so reizvolle Forschungsziele.[PARAGRAPH:1]Durch den Bau des Wunders "Groﬂe Mauer" kann das Erscheinen von Groﬂen Gener&#228;len noch weiter beschleunigt werden. Dieses Wunder h&#228;lt nicht nur Barbaren ab, sondern erh&#246;ht auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Erscheinens von Groﬂen Gener&#228;len bei K&#228;mpfen innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen um 100%, was mit dieser Eigenschaft zu einer Steigerung der Wahrscheinlichkeit um 200% f&#252;hrt, wenn K&#228;mpfe innerhalb der eigenen Grenzen gewonnen werden. Die Erforschung der Technologie "Steinmetzkunst" und die Erlangung von Steinressourcen geh&#246;ren somit auch zu den ersten Priorit&#228;ten dieser Eigenschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der beste Weg, die Eigenschaft "Imperialistisch" nach der Phase der fr&#252;hen Expansion zu nutzen, ist einfach: Krieg. Man sollte oft und fr&#252;hzeitig Krieg f&#252;hren. Nur so k&#246;nnen Groﬂe Gener&#228;le erscheinen (K&#228;mpfe gegen Barbaren erbringen zwar Erfahrungspunkte, tragen aber nicht zum Erscheinen eines Groﬂen Generals bei). Groﬂe Gener&#228;le geh&#246;ren tats&#228;chlich zu den n&#252;tzlichsten Groﬂen Pers&#246;nlichkeiten im Spiel, auch wenn ihnen einige der Eigenschaften der anderen GPs fehlen (wie Beschleunigung der Forschung oder das Einl&#228;uten eines Goldenen Zeitalters). Sie k&#246;nnen anderen Einheiten zugewiesen werden, um diese mehrfach zu bef&#246;rdern, in St&#228;dten die Erfahrungspunkte neuer Einheiten erh&#246;hen oder die Einheitenproduktion durch eine Milit&#228;rakademie beschleunigen. Dabei sollte bedacht werden, das die Technolgie "Gesetzgebung" bevorzugt erforscht und die Errichtung von Gerichtsgeb&#228;uden priorisiert werden sollte, um das stets wachsende Imperium &#246;konomisch am Leben zu erhalten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Viele Spieler kombinieren bevorzugt den ersten Groﬂen General mit einer Einheit und geben ihr die Bef&#246;rderungen "Sanit&#228;ter I, II und III". Diese Sanit&#228;tseinheit l&#228;sst Armeen schneller heilen, so dass diese viel schneller in neue Schlachten ziehen k&#246;nnen. Ein Groﬂer General kann auch die Bef&#246;rderung "F&#252;hrerschaft" erteilen, die sich mit der Eigenschaft "Imperialistisch" bestens erg&#228;nzt, da diese Bef&#246;rderung einer Einheit doppelte EPs nach jedem siegreichen Kampf gew&#228;hrt, die dann nat&#252;rlich auch doppelt zum Erscheinen des n&#228;chsten Groﬂen Generals beitragen. Man kann den GG auch mit einer Karavelle kombinieren, um ihr die Bef&#246;rderungen "Flanke I" und "Navigation I und II" zu verleihen, und so den Gewinn des Weltumseglungsbonus praktisch zu garantieren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem das Ziel eine m&#246;glichst groﬂe Anzahl Groﬂe Gener&#228;le ist (und die Strategie zum Groﬂteil auf ihren Nutzen ausgerichtet ist), sollte man sich auch zuerst den kostenlosen GG durch die Ersterforschung der Technologie "Faschismus" sichern. Bei all der Kriegstreiberei sollte das Wunder "Mount Rushmore" errichtet und die Staatsform "Polizeistaat" angenommen werden, um einen Teil der Kriegsm&#252;digkeit zu mildern.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Nachteile[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Nun, zun&#228;chst einmal gibt es kein verg&#252;nstigtes Geb&#228;ude und keinen wirtschaftlichen Vorteil. Es erscheint logisch, dass "Imperialistisch" &#252;ber g&#252;nstige Gerichtsgeb&#228;ude verf&#252;gen sollte, doch diesen Bonus hat bereits die Eigenschaft "Organisiert", die ohne ihn zu sehr geschw&#228;cht w&#252;rde. Vielleicht w&#228;ren Gef&#228;ngnisse geeignete verg&#252;nstigte Geb&#228;ude f&#252;r "Imperialistisch". Wenn es in Civilization IV vern&#252;nftige Forts g&#228;be, w&#228;ren f&#252;r diese schnellere Bauzeiten in Kombination mit dieser Eigenschaft sinnvoll gewesen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Statt g&#252;nstigen Geb&#228;uden gibt es aber eine g&#252;nstige Einheit. Aber die Produktionsbeschleunigung von Siedlern erw&#228;chst aus H&#228;mmern, nicht aus Nahrung. Deshalb muss schon fr&#252;h mit widerspr&#252;chlichen Vorgaben gearbeitet werden, da Minen errichtet werden m&#252;ssen, damit die Siedlerproduktion die Vorteile dieser Eigenschaft nutzen kann. Wenn Nahrung die Siedlerproduktion ebenfalls beschleunigen w&#252;rde, w&#228;re dies eine viel st&#228;rkere Eigenschaft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die gr&#246;ﬂte Schw&#228;che dieser Eigenschaft liegt jedoch darin, dass sie den Spieler auf eine spezielle Strategie festlegt. Mit der Eigenschaft "Agressiv" muss man nicht den Kriegstreiber spielen. Man kann sie auch einsetzen, um eine starke Armee und milit&#228;rische Infrastruktur aufzubauen (schlieﬂlich bestimmen auch die billigen Kasernen und Trockendocks den Rang), und wird dann beim Ausbau der Imperiums in Ruhe gelassen. Mit "Imperialistisch" gibt es aber keine Alternative zum Krieg. Es gibt keinen anderen Weg, das Erscheinen von Groﬂen Gener&#228;len zu f&#246;rdern, als durch den Kampf mit anderen Zivilisationen. Deshalb sollte diese Eigenschaft nur gew&#228;hlt werden, wenn man in der Stimmung ist, ein paar K&#246;pfe rollen zu lassen, sonst ist sie verschwendet.</German>

Great Generals are actually one of the most useful Great People in the game, even if they lack some of the uses of other GPs (such as lightbulbing technologies or starting a Golden Age). You can attach them to units to uber-promote them, put them in cities to provide additional XPs or boost unit production with a military academy. Just remember to prioritize Code of Laws and courthouses to keep your ever-expanding empire economically viable.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many players favour combining the first Great General with a unit and giving it the Medic I, II, and III promotions. This medic unit will heal your stacks faster, allowing them to return to the fray much sooner. You can also use a GG to give a unit the Leadership promotion, which creates synergy with the Imperialistic trait because the promotion results in double XPs for that unit from every battle it survives, and those double XPs are doubled again in their count towards your next Great General. You can also combine the GG with a Caravel to give it Flanking I, Navigtion I, and Navigation II in order to practically guarantee winning the circumnavigation bonus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since you're going after several Great Generals (and likely basing much of your strategy on their benefits), you'll want to snag the free one that you get from researching Fascism first. With all the warmongering you'll be doing, you're going to want to build Mount Rushmore and run Police State to alleviate some of the War Weariness anyway.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Well, for starters, there's no cheap building and no economic advantage. It seems logical that Imperialistic should have cheap courthouses, but Organized has those, and shifting them away would seriously weaken that trait. Perhaps jails would have been a good cheap building for Imperialistic. If Civ IV had useful forts, faster build times of those would have been logical for this trait as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Instead of a cheap building, however, there's a cheap unit. But Imperialistic's boost to Settler builds comes from hammers, not food. This means you need to work at cross-purposes in the early game, building mines to ensure your Settler builds take advantage of the trait. If food also boosted the Setter's build time, this would be a much stronger trait.[PARAGRAPH:1]The biggest weakness of the trait, however, is that it locks you into a specific strategy. You don't have to play as a warmonger with the Aggressive trait; you could leverage it to build a strong army and military infrastructure (the cheap barracks and drydocks count towards your power rating, after all) so you're left alone to build. With Imperialistic, however, you have to warmonger. There's no other way to earn those Great Generals except by fighting other civs. Don't play with this trait unless you're in the mood to knock heads, or you're wasting it.</Spanish>

Let's just say my recommendation with the Philosophical trait is to run a SE or at least a "hybrid economy" where some cities focus on food and specialists and others focus on cottages and commerce. (A hybrid economy is especially suitable for Elizabeth of England, who has the Financial trait that, as mentioned above, requires a certain amount of cottage spam to take full advantage of it.)[PARAGRAPH:1]Within the SE community, opinions differ as to the importance of building the Pyramids. The appeal of the Pyramids to a SE is to run the Representation civic extremely early in the game. This civic raises the happiness cap of your five largest cities on a standard-sized map (which are probably your only cities early on). This allows you to grow those cities even larger so you can work more farms and run more specialists. In addition, every specialist contributes an additional three research points under Representation beyond whatever research points they normally contribute--even those that normally don't contribute any research, such as engineers, priests, merchants, and ordinary citizen specialists. The science contribution of artists and spies goes up from 1 to 4 under representation, while the contribution of scientists doubles from 3 to 6. Obviously the Pyramids and early Representation hyper-charge the SE, but many maintain the SE can get along without either the wonder or the civic.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Parthenon can also be a useful wonder to a Philosophical leader. You're already relying on Great People for technologies, so why not build a wonder that increases the number of GP you'll get?[PARAGRAPH:1]Writing will be an early priority technology so you can build libraries and run your first scientists. Wonders can be very useful since they all contribute GP points; go after the wonders that contribute GPP towards the types of Great People you most want and need. Since Great Scientists are usually the most useful GPs, that makes the Great Library a very attractive wonder for leaders with the Philosophical trait. Mercantilism contributes a free specialist for each city, as does the Statue of Liberty (and without the "no foreign trade routes" price of Mercantilism). The Caste System civic is a huge boon to the SE and the Philosophical trait, allowing you to run as many merchants, scientists, and/or artists as a city can support. Therefore Code of Laws is a priority technology. Education enables the Philosophical trait's cheap building, the University, so that's a priority as well. Philosophy makes the Pacifism civic available, which provides a further +100% boost to GP production in cities that have your state religion. Biology will allow you to grow larger cities and support more specialists, so prioritize that tech later in the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]The National Park national wonder benefits the SE as it allows 1 free specialist for every forest preserve. It means, though, that you have to be careful to preserve some forests or even jungles in the fat cross of the city where you build it.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Running a specialist economy requires a great deal more micro-management than running the more-straightforward cottage economy. The game will take longer to play and you'll need to manage everything much more closely.

Great People get more expensive to produce and appear less frequently, while technologies become too expensive for your specialists and fewer Great People to research efficiently.

You're already relying on Great People for technologies, so why not build a wonder that increases the number of GP you'll get?[PARAGRAPH:1]Writing will be an early priority technology so you can build libraries and run your first scientists. Wonders can be very useful since they all contribute GP points; go after the wonders that contribute GPP towards the types of Great People you most want and need. Since Great Scientists are usually the most useful GPs, that makes the Great Library a very attractive wonder for leaders with the Philosophical trait. Mercantilism contributes a free specialist for each city, as does the Statue of Liberty (and without the "no foreign trade routes" price of Mercantilism). The Caste System civic is a huge boon to the SE and the Philosophical trait, allowing you to run as many merchants, scientists, and/or artists as a city can support. Therefore Code of Laws is a priority technology. Education enables the Philosophical trait's cheap building, the University, so that's a priority as well. Philosophy makes the Pacifism civic available, which provides a further +100% boost to GP production in cities that have your state religion. Biology will allow you to grow larger cities and support more specialists, so prioritize that tech later in the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]The National Park national wonder benefits the SE as it allows 1 free specialist for every forest preserve.

Either that, or you will need to transition to a cottage economy; a switch to the Emancipation civic will be essential to pulling this off.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unlike the Financial trait, the Philosophical trait does not provide any direct economic benefits.

		<Spanish>[TAB]Just as the Financial trait lends itself to the Commerce Economy, the Philosophical trait lends itself to the Specialist Economy (SE). The SE, of course, has many adherents, and the debate over which economy is best rages on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suffice it to say that the SE is strongest in the hands of a Philosophical leader, since running all those specialists will result in many more Great People. You don't have to run a SE with a Philosophical leader, just as you can run a CE without the Financial trait, but the SE and the Philosophical trait are both at their strongest when combined.[PARAGRAPH:1]Great People have many uses, of course. In the Specialist Economy, they are principally used for "lightbulbing", that is, using the Great Person to discover a technology, usually research-free. You can then trade this "free technology" for techs you need from other civilizations. This allows you to run the research slider at 0% for most of the game while you rely on a combination of scientists and tech trades to keep up in research. (My version of the SE in a nutshell.)[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_WRITING]Writing[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_POLYTHEISM]Polytheism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PHILOSOPHY]Philosophy[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_EDUCATION]Education[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_BIOLOGY]Biology[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PYRAMID]The Pyramids[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PARTHENON]The Parthenon[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_GREAT_LIBRARY]The Great Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_STATUE_OF_LIBERTY]The Statue of Liberty[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_NATIONAL_PARK]National Park[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_UNIVERSITY]University[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_PACIFISM]Pacifism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_REPRESENTATION]Representation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_CASTE_SYSTEM]Caste System[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=CIVIC_MERCANTILISM]Mercantilism[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]I won't go into the details on how to run a SE, because that's beyond the scope of this article. Let's just say my recommendation with the Philosophical trait is to run a SE or at least a "hybrid economy" where some cities focus on food and specialists and others focus on cottages and commerce. (A hybrid economy is especially suitable for Elizabeth of England, who has the Financial trait that, as mentioned above, requires a certain amount of cottage spam to take full advantage of it.)[PARAGRAPH:1]Within the SE community, opinions differ as to the importance of building the Pyramids. The appeal of the Pyramids to a SE is to run the Representation civic extremely early in the game. This civic raises the happiness cap of your five largest cities on a standard-sized map (which are probably your only cities early on). This allows you to grow those cities even larger so you can work more farms and run more specialists. In addition, every specialist contributes an additional three research points under Representation beyond whatever research points they normally contribute--even those that normally don't contribute any research, such as engineers, priests, merchants, and ordinary citizen specialists. The science contribution of artists and spies goes up from 1 to 4 under representation, while the contribution of scientists doubles from 3 to 6. Obviously the Pyramids and early Representation hyper-charge the SE, but many maintain the SE can get along without either the wonder or the civic.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Parthenon can also be a useful wonder to a Philosophical leader. You're already relying on Great People for technologies, so why not build a wonder that increases the number of GP you'll get?[PARAGRAPH:1]Writing will be an early priority technology so you can build libraries and run your first scientists.

Since Great Scientists are usually the most useful GPs, that makes the Great Library a very attractive wonder for leaders with the Philosophical trait. Mercantilism contributes a free specialist for each city, as does the Statue of Liberty (and without the "no foreign trade routes" price of Mercantilism). The Caste System civic is a huge boon to the SE and the Philosophical trait, allowing you to run as many merchants, scientists, and/or artists as a city can support. Therefore Code of Laws is a priority technology. Education enables the Philosophical trait's cheap building, the University, so that's a priority as well.

When you capture a city, your freely-promoted units are better equipped to defend your new possession, which is highly likely to come under a counter-attack. In fact, your gunpowder units can potentially perform double-duty as both attackers and defenders. (Most archery units, however, are weak attackers and are best used on defense only.)[PARAGRAPH:1]If you have a source of stone, the walls and castles are even cheaper, making them less of a burden to build. Combined with wonders like the Temple of Artemis and the Great Lighthouse, you could make Protective's cheap castles part of a trade route economy, which can be very helpful in the mid-game period.

The free City Garrison promotion is only useful when units are under attack while in a city.

Only the free Drill I promotion is an attacking promotion, but how often do you attack with archery units? Unless they're Cho-Ko- Nus, of course.

Your units have to venture out of your cities to defend your territory, which makes walls and castles next to useless--ditto with the City Garrison promotion.[PARAGRAPH:1]In many ways, the Protective trait seems to have been added more to benefit the AI than the human player. The AI prefers to play defensively for the most part, so Protective suits its programming. Any human player will tell you that going up against Protective Longbowmen, fortified in a city on a hill with a castle and walls, can be intimidating--though certainly not insurmountable.

You can also use the cheap castles to supplement espionage in BtS. In fact, some players have begun playing an EP, or "Espionage Economy", where the science slider is turned down to 0% after Alphabet and most remaining technologies are acquired through tech-stealing.[PARAGRAPH:1]The civilization that probably benefits the most from the trait is China, because its UU is one of the best Archery units in the game--the Cho-Ko-Nu, which can and should be used as an attacking unit. Drill I just enhances its power, giving it an additional first strike chance beyond its 2 free first strikes.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The problem with the Protective trait is that it's largely defensive in nature. The free City Garrison promotion is only useful when units are under attack while in a city. Walls and castles--which are pretty cheap to begin with, making their double production speed less appealing--are likewise only useful when you're under attack. Only the free Drill I promotion is an attacking promotion, but how often do you attack with archery units? Unless they're Cho-Ko- Nus, of course. (Though it can be beneficial to your more aggressive gunpowder units.)[PARAGRAPH:1]The problem with playing defensively in Civilization IV is that the AI is so fond of pillaging. If your units cower behind city walls, the AI will gleefully send your economy spiraling down into ruin by pillaging every tile improvement in sight. Your units have to venture out of your cities to defend your territory, which makes walls and castles next to useless--ditto with the City Garrison promotion.[PARAGRAPH:1]In many ways, the Protective trait seems to have been added more to benefit the AI than the human player. The AI prefers to play defensively for the most part, so Protective suits its programming. Any human player will tell you that going up against Protective Longbowmen, fortified in a city on a hill with a castle and walls, can be intimidating--though certainly not insurmountable. Just bring more Trebuchets to the party.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]As with Financial, Spiritual's great strength comes from its positive impact on your economy. Anarchy means that for one turn or more, your cities do not grow or build anything, your culture does not increase, GPP are not accumulated, cottages do not grow, and so on. Spiritual means you avoid those periods of economic stasis; this should result in your being able to research at least one or two additional technologies, build several more units and buildings, produce more Great People, and so on, compared to a non-Spiritual civ.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unlike several other traits, Spiritual's effects do not decrease later in the game. On the contrary, as more civics and religions become available, you may want and need to change civics more often, and Spiritual lets you do so.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, this trait has slipped, in my opinion, from being one of the strongest to being a medium-strength trait. This is mainly because of the Beyond the Sword expansion pack. Frankly, many disputed my inclusion of it in the "Strong" category to begin with. But Beyond the Sword has reduced its strength by making its effects easier to obtain. You now only need to use one Great Person, not two, in order to bring about your first Golden Age; and you can now change civics anarchy-free during a Golden Age. This is just one of many was that Golden Ages have been improved and made more attractive in Beyond the Sword.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, in the late game, when you have access to all the civics and Spiritual is normally at its strongest, you can now achieve the same effects by building the new Cristo Redentor wonder, which not only gives you Spiritual's ability to change civics anarchy-free; you can also change civics without having to wait for a single turn change, let alone the usual five! (Note: in the BtS 3.13 patch, this has been changed to a 1 turn waiting period between civics changes.)[PARAGRAPH:1]So Spiritual, to my mind, has fallen from strong to medium not through any fault of its own, but through easier access to its benefits to non-Spiritual leaders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that enable civics (e.g. [LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that found religions (e.g. [LINK=TECH_MEDITATION]Meditation[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DIVINE_RIGHT]Divine Right[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PAPER]Paper[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PYRAMID]The Pyramids[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SANKORE]The University of Sankore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SPIRAL_MINARET]The Spiral Minaret[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_APOSTOLIC_PALACE]The Apostolic Palace[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SHWEDAGON_PAYA]Shwedagon Paya[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SISTINE_CHAPEL]The Sistine Chapel[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Temples[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Monasteries[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Nearly all of them--if it offers a worthwhile benefit and fits your strategy, switch to it.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]No anarchy means you can adopt a civic right now, as soon as it's available, and gain its advantages immediately, rather than waiting to change several civics at once as a prudent non-Spiritual leader would do. So if a civic would benefit you, don't hesitate to switch to it. The only restraint you have is waiting five turns until you can change civics again.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are also diplomatic benefits. You can easily convert to a religion or change to a favoured civic to court another civilization. Once you gain what you need from them--say, a tech trade--you can convert religions or civics back just as easily. However, do keep in mind that diplomatic bonuses for shared religions or favoured civics can take several turns to accumulate to a significant level.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Pyramids are an attractive wonder for a Spiritual leader, since they enable all the government civics early on, letting you leverage the trait early in the game. Obviously, any tech that enables a civic is valuable and should be prioritized--provided the civic is worthwhile. In Beyond the Sword, the Shwedagon Paya is also attractive, since it's the religious equivalent of the Pyramids, enabling all religious civics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temples are modest buildings, producing +1 culture and keeping one citizen happy. However, Spiritual's cheap temples can truly shine if you build the Spiral Minaret (enabled by Divine Right), the University of Sankore (Paper), and the Apostolic Palace (Theology). These wonders make the temples of your state religion produce +1 gold, +2 research, and +2 hammers, respectively. (Please note that if you don't build the AP, you can still get its +2 hammer boost for all religious buildings by adopting the AP religion as your state religion.) Just be aware that building one or more of these wonders makes the Free Religion civic unappealing, and lowers the priority of Computers and Mass Media, which obsolete the wonders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Spiritual is the inverse of a trait like Creative: it is very weak early in the game when there are few civics available. Its benefits come later as more civics come on line. Realistically, most of your civics changes will occur in the mid-game, though obviously this can vary, but in most games I find myself taking less advantage of the Spiritual trait in the late game.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, while Spiritual may allow you to "save money", unlike Financial, the trait it doesn't directly produce any. You'll need to have a sound economy, as usual.[PARAGRAPH:1]You may be tempted, when playing as a Spiritual leader, to switch to any civic as soon as it's available. Remember that some civics have high maintenance costs compared to others; ensure the civic is worthwhile in some respect before changing. Also remember that just because a civic is made available, that doesn't mean it's necessarily optimal for you at that point in the game. Consider your choices carefully and make sure your civics fit into your overall strategy and the circumstances within the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]To gain the benefits of the cheap temples, you need a state religion. You'll therefore need to either found a religion or have one spread to you. In addition, you may need or want to adopt a state religion very early on, and that may have diplomatic repercussions for you.</English>

(Note: in the BtS 3.13 patch, this has been changed to a 1 turn waiting period between civics changes.)[PARAGRAPH:1]So Spiritual, to my mind, has fallen from strong to medium not through any fault of its own, but through easier access to its benefits to non-Spiritual leaders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that enable civics (e.g. [LINK=TECH_CODE_OF_LAWS]Code of Laws[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Those that found religions (e.g. [LINK=TECH_MEDITATION]Meditation[\LINK])[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_DIVINE_RIGHT]Divine Right[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=TECH_PAPER]Paper[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_PYRAMID]The Pyramids[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SANKORE]The University of Sankore[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SPIRAL_MINARET]The Spiral Minaret[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_APOSTOLIC_PALACE]The Apostolic Palace[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SHWEDAGON_PAYA]Shwedagon Paya[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_SISTINE_CHAPEL]The Sistine Chapel[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Temples[PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Monasteries[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET]Nearly all of them--if it offers a worthwhile benefit and fits your strategy, switch to it.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]No anarchy means you can adopt a civic right now, as soon as it's available, and gain its advantages immediately, rather than waiting to change several civics at once as a prudent non-Spiritual leader would do. So if a civic would benefit you, don't hesitate to switch to it. The only restraint you have is waiting five turns until you can change civics again.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are also diplomatic benefits. You can easily convert to a religion or change to a favoured civic to court another civilization. Once you gain what you need from them--say, a tech trade--you can convert religions or civics back just as easily. However, do keep in mind that diplomatic bonuses for shared religions or favoured civics can take several turns to accumulate to a significant level.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Pyramids are an attractive wonder for a Spiritual leader, since they enable all the government civics early on, letting you leverage the trait early in the game. Obviously, any tech that enables a civic is valuable and should be prioritized--provided the civic is worthwhile. In Beyond the Sword, the Shwedagon Paya is also attractive, since it's the religious equivalent of the Pyramids, enabling all religious civics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temples are modest buildings, producing +1 culture and keeping one citizen happy. However, Spiritual's cheap temples can truly shine if you build the Spiral Minaret (enabled by Divine Right), the University of Sankore (Paper), and the Apostolic Palace (Theology). These wonders make the temples of your state religion produce +1 gold, +2 research, and +2 hammers, respectively. (Please note that if you don't build the AP, you can still get its +2 hammer boost for all religious buildings by adopting the AP religion as your state religion.) Just be aware that building one or more of these wonders makes the Free Religion civic unappealing, and lowers the priority of Computers and Mass Media, which obsolete the wonders.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Spiritual is the inverse of a trait like Creative: it is very weak early in the game when there are few civics available. Its benefits come later as more civics come on line. Realistically, most of your civics changes will occur in the mid-game, though obviously this can vary, but in most games I find myself taking less advantage of the Spiritual trait in the late game.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition, while Spiritual may allow you to "save money", unlike Financial, the trait it doesn't directly produce any. You'll need to have a sound economy, as usual.[PARAGRAPH:1]You may be tempted, when playing as a Spiritual leader, to switch to any civic as soon as it's available. Remember that some civics have high maintenance costs compared to others; ensure the civic is worthwhile in some respect before changing. Also remember that just because a civic is made available, that doesn't mean it's necessarily optimal for you at that point in the game. Consider your choices carefully and make sure your civics fit into your overall strategy and the circumstances within the game.[PARAGRAPH:1]To gain the benefits of the cheap temples, you need a state religion. You'll therefore need to either found a religion or have one spread to you. In addition, you may need or want to adopt a state religion very early on, and that may have diplomatic repercussions for you.</Spanish>
