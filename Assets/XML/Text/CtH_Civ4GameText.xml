        <English>[H1]Lieu-Ye[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Funan[NEWLINE]Lived: [\BOLD] 1st-2nd century[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Lieu-Ye (or Liuyè, Yèliu, Neang Neak, later Soma) formed out of the different Khmer tribes the first historical Cambodian kingdom, the kingdom of Funan, also referred to as Kok Thlork or Nokor Phnom (mountain country). The ancient kingdom was located around the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam and in southern Cambodia. From archeological evidence, which includes Roman, Chinese, and Indian goods excavated at the ancient mercantile center of Oc Eo in southern Vietnam, it is known that Funan must have been a powerful trading state. Lieu-Ye later married the Indian brahmin Hùntián (also Preah Thong, later Kaundinya), consolidating the young kingdom by integrating the Indian cultur. After their marriage, they were known as King Kaundinya and Queen Soma of Funan.
    Most of what is known about the early Funan and its first ruler is taken from ancient chinese texts, which are contradictory. For example, in one text Hùntián is the founder of Funan. He came to this area after he had dreamt that his personal genie had delivered a divine bow to him and had directed him to embark on a large merchant junk. In the morning, he proceeded to the temple, where he found a bow at the foot of the genie's tree. He then boarded a ship, which the genie caused to land in Funan. The queen of the country, Liuyè, wanted to pillage the ship and seize it, so Hùntián shot an arrow from his divine bow which pierced through Liuyè's ship. Frightened, she gave herself up, and Hùntián took her for his wife. Then he governed the country and passed power on to his son, who was the founder of seven cities.
    Another text mentions Lieu-Ye as a naga (snake) princess named Soma, who Hùntián takes as wife. This is paralleled in modern Khmer folklore, where the foreign prince is known as Preah Thaong and the queen as Neang Neak. In this version of the story, Preah Thaong arrives by sea to an island marked by a giant thlok tree, native to Cambodia. On the Island, he finds the home of the nagas and meets Neang Neak, daughter of the naga king. He marries her with blessings from her father and returns to the human world. The naga king drinks the sea around the island and confers the name Kampuchea Thipdei (the lord of Cambodia). In another version, it is stated that Preah Thaong fights Neang Neak.
    As can be seen, historical facts are rather slim about Lieu-Ye and her husband Hùntián. Still, both are important persons in the history of the Funan kingdom, and even if Lieu-Ye did not found the kingdom herself, she still most certainly ruled this area as Queen piror the arrival of Hùntián.
    In memory of Queen Lieu-Ye's matriarchy as well as in honor of every mother and all Cambodian women, the word me, or mother, has been used in the Khmer language to prefix or precede certain words to express the state of greatness, leadership, or of being the most important article.</English>

    As can be seen, historical facts are rather slim about Lieu-Ye and her husband Hùntián. Still, both are important persons in the history of the Funan kingdom, and even if Lieu-Ye did not found the kingdom herself, she still most certainly ruled this area as Queen piror the arrival of Hùntián.
    In memory of Queen Lieu-Ye's matriarchy as well as in honor of every mother and all Cambodian women, the word me, or mother, has been used in the Khmer language to prefix or precede certain words to express the state of greatness, leadership, or of being the most important article.</German>
    <Italian>[H1]Lieu-Ye[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Funan[NEWLINE]Lived: [\BOLD] 1st-2nd century[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Lieu-Ye (or Liuyè, Yèliu, Neang Neak, later Soma) formed out of the different Khmer tribes the first historical Cambodian kingdom, the kingdom of Funan, also referred to as Kok Thlork or Nokor Phnom (mountain country). The ancient kingdom was located around the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam and in southern Cambodia. From archeological evidence, which includes Roman, Chinese, and Indian goods excavated at the ancient mercantile center of Oc Eo in southern Vietnam, it is known that Funan must have been a powerful trading state. Lieu-Ye later married the Indian brahmin Hùntián (also Preah Thong, later Kaundinya), consolidating the young kingdom by integrating the Indian cultur. After their marriage, they were known as King Kaundinya and Queen Soma of Funan.
    Most of what is known about the early Funan and its first ruler is taken from ancient chinese texts, which are contradictory. For example, in one text Hùntián is the founder of Funan. He came to this area after he had dreamt that his personal genie had delivered a divine bow to him and had directed him to embark on a large merchant junk. In the morning, he proceeded to the temple, where he found a bow at the foot of the genie's tree. He then boarded a ship, which the genie caused to land in Funan. The queen of the country, Liuyè, wanted to pillage the ship and seize it, so Hùntián shot an arrow from his divine bow which pierced through Liuyè's ship. Frightened, she gave herself up, and Hùntián took her for his wife. Then he governed the country and passed power on to his son, who was the founder of seven cities.
    Another text mentions Lieu-Ye as a naga (snake) princess named Soma, who Hùntián takes as wife. This is paralleled in modern Khmer folklore, where the foreign prince is known as Preah Thaong and the queen as Neang Neak. In this version of the story, Preah Thaong arrives by sea to an island marked by a giant thlok tree, native to Cambodia. On the Island, he finds the home of the nagas and meets Neang Neak, daughter of the naga king. He marries her with blessings from her father and returns to the human world. The naga king drinks the sea around the island and confers the name Kampuchea Thipdei (the lord of Cambodia). In another version, it is stated that Preah Thaong fights Neang Neak.

In the Peninsular War between Spain and France in 1808, San Martin began as an aide to the Spanish leadership; by war's end he had attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the midst of the war, the Spanish king abdicated from power to be replaced by an appointment of the opposing French. The citizens of Argentina, upon hearing of the Spanish government's state of disarray, decided that there would be no better time to declare independence. When news of the Argentine revolution reached him, San Martin elected to support the rebels' cause, leaving Spain for the New World. Upon his arrival, he was immediately recruited by the rebel forces to begin mustering and training an elite regiment. His regiment, known as the Mounted Grenadiers, became some of the finest troops South America had to offer.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once his troops were ready, the normally reserved drillmaster suggested a daring move - marching an army from Argentina to Chile through the peaks of the Andes. His plan was regarded as madness by many, but San Martin managed to muster more than enough brave souls to join him in the endeavor. Dividing his forces into six columns for easier travel through the difficult terrain, San Martin planned for each column to arrive within two days of one another, a highly unlikely prospect given the extreme terrain and great danger that lay ahead.[PARAGRAPH:2]But on February 12, nearly all four thousand troops stepped out from the shadows of the Andes onto the plains of Chacabuco, prepared to face the numerically superior Spanish forces. Despite having just traversed some of the most inhospitable terrain on earth, San Martin's "Army of the Andes," soundly defeated the Royalists. They then marched on the Chilean capital of Santiago, taking the city with little fuss. Despite what many thought to be a crushing loss on the field of Tacla roughly a month later, Chile was to remain in the hands of San Martin and his revolutionary followers.[PARAGRAPH:2]The citizens of Chile attempted to appoint San Martin governor of their colony, but he refused. He had his sights set on the bastion of Spanish power in South America - Lima, Peru. San Martin took his forces north, offering the Spanish forces in Lima the opportunity to surrender and set up a new constitutional government. Their refusal sealed their fate - in 1821, San Martin marched into Lima, taking the city for the rebels. He was soon proclaimed the first President of Peru.[PARAGRAPH:2]Small pockets of Spanish forces remained scattered throughout the Peruvian countryside and in order to ensure their removal, San Martin requested a conference with Simon Bolivar, the Liberator of the north whose military zone of influence overlapped that of San Martin.[PARAGRAPH:2]The two met in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1822. What they discussed is unknown, but the result is - on that day San Martin stepped down from his position, leaving the fate of South America in the hands of Bolivar. San Martin had previously displayed a wavering of passion for his cause, but it took the words of Bolivar to force a decision. Upon stepping down, San Martin settled with his wife and children on a farm in Argentina for two years before migrating to Europe, where he spent the remainder of his days moving from country to country in order to escape the numerous revolutions sweeping the continent at the time. He died in France in 1850.</English>

        <English>[H1]Nebuchadnezzar II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Babylon[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 605-562 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar II, more often called Nebuchadnezzar, or even Nebuchadnezzar the Great, was a ruler in the Chaldean Dynasty of Babylon. He is famous for his building in Babylon, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, his role in the Book of Daniel, and his conquests of Judah and Jerusalem. His name in Akkadian is usually interpreted as "O Nebo, defend my kudurru." Nebo was the Babylonian deity of wisdom, and a kudurru is an inscribed stone deed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar was the oldest son and successor of Nabopolassar. Nabopolassar ended Babylons dependence on Assyria and left Nineveh in ruins. He married Amytis of Media, granddaughter or daughter of Cyaxares, king of the Medes. Thusly, the Median and Babylonian dynasties were one. Necho II, king of Egypt, gained victory at Carchemish over the Assyrians. The remaining Assyrian provinces were divided amongst Babylon and Media. Nabopolassar was intent on reconquering Necho. In the Battle of Carchemish, the Egyptians were defeated and Syria and Phoenicia were Babylonian. In 605 BC, Nabopolassar died, and Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the defeats of the Cimmerians and Scythians, Nebuchadnezzars campaigns were directed westward. The only power that wasnt west was the Medians. A political marriage between Amuhia, daughter of the Median king, ensured a lasting peace between the Babylonians and Medians. Nebuchadnezzar wanted to increase Babylonian influence in Syria and Judah. However, rebellions in the states of Levant caused setbacks. Nebuchadnezzar dealt with these rebellions and captured Jerusalem. In 587 BC, another siege on Jerusalem leads to the destruction of the city, Temple, and deportation of important citizens. After the destruction of the temple, Nebuchadnezzar began a thirteen year long siege of Tyre, which ended in the Tyrians accepting Babylonian authority. After he completed his job in Phoenicia, Nebuchadnezzar began to punish the Egyptians.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar was not only proud of his victories, but his buildings. Babylon was greatly devastated by the Assyrian kings Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal. Nebuchadnezzar had a goal of making Babylon one of the worlds wonders. Old temples were restored, edifices erected to many gods, completion of the palace, and more. Nebuchadnezzar did so much work, there is not a place in all of Babylon where one wouldnt find his name, or a trace of his greatness. Nebuchadnezzar built the Hanging Gardens to remind his wife Amytis of her homeland in Media.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar, in the second year of his reign, had dreams to erect a large image of himself made of various materials. When three Jews refuse to take part in the building of one of these images, Nebuchadnezzar throws them into a furnace. Nebuchadnezzar has another dream of an immense tree. Nebuchadnezzar is humbled by God when he boasts of his achievements. Nebuchadnezzar then becomes insane, and lives like an animal for seven years. After this, his sanity and position is restored. Some scholars suggest that these stories are a mix of Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon.[PARAGRAPH:1]After his death in 562 BC, he was succeeded by his son Amel-Marduk. Amel-Marduk had a short reign of two years, and was succeeded by Neriglissar, who was succeeded by Nabonidus. Babylon fell under Cyrus the Great as the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia.</English>

Son nom dans Akkadian est habituellement interprété comme « O Nebo, défendent mon kudurru. » Nebo était la déité babylonienne de la sagesse, et un kudurru est un contrat en pierre inscrit.

Nabopolassar était attentif sur reconquering Necho. Dans la bataille de Carchemish, les Egyptiens ont été défaits et la Syrie et Phoenicia étaient babyloniens. Dans 605 AVANT JÉSUS CHRIST, Nabopolassar mort, et Nebuchadnezzar sont montés le trône. [PARAGRAPH : 1] Après les défaites du Cimmerians et du Scythians, les campagnes de Nebuchadnezzar ont été dirigées à l'ouest. La seule puissance qui n'était pas occidentale était les médianes. Un mariage politique entre Amuhia, fille du roi médian, a assuré une paix durable entre les Babyloniens et les médianes. Nebuchadnezzar a voulu augmenter l'influence babylonienne en Syrie et Judah. Cependant, les rébellions dans les états de Levant ont causé des reculs. Nebuchadnezzar a traité ces rébellions et a capturé Jérusalem. Dans 587 AVANT JÉSUS CHRIST, un autre siège sur Jérusalem mène à la destruction de la ville, du temple, et de la déportation des citoyens importants. Après la destruction du temple, Nebuchadnezzar a commencé un siège de treize ans de long de pneu, qui a fini dans le Tyrians acceptant l'autorité babylonienne. Après qu'il ait accompli son travail dans Phoenicia, Nebuchadnezzar a commencé à punir les Egyptiens. [PARAGRAPH : 1] Nebuchadnezzar était non seulement fier de ses victoires, mais de ses bâtiments. Babylone a été considérablement dévastée par les Rois assyriens Sennacherib et Ashurbanipal. Nebuchadnezzar a eu un but de faire Babylone une des merveilles du monde. De vieux temples ont été reconstitués, les édifices ont été érigés à beaucoup de dieux, accomplissement du palais, et davantage. Nebuchadnezzar a tellement fonctionné, il n'y a pas un endroit en tout de Babylone où on ne trouverait pas son nom, ou d'une trace de sa grandeur. Nebuchadnezzar a construit les jardins accrochants pour rappeler son épouse Amytis sa patrie dans les médias.

Quand trois juifs refusent de participer au bâtiment d'une de ces images, Nebuchadnezzar les jette dans un four. Nebuchadnezzar a un autre rêve d'un immense arbre. Nebuchadnezzar est humilié par God quand il se vante de ses accomplissements. Nebuchadnezzar devient alors aliéné, et vit comme un animal pendant sept années. Après ceci, sa santé d'esprit et position est reconstituée. Quelques disciples proposent que ces histoires soient un mélange de Nebuchadnezzar et Nabonidus, le dernier roi de Babylone.

        <German>[H1]Nebukadnezar II.[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]K&#246;nig von Babylonien[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 605-562 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar II, more often called Nebuchadnezzar, or even Nebuchadnezzar the Great, was a ruler in the Chaldean Dynasty of Babylon. He is famous for his building in Babylon, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, his role in the Book of Daniel, and his conquests of Judah and Jerusalem. His name in Akkadian is usually interpreted as "O Nebo, defend my kudurru." Nebo was the Babylonian deity of wisdom, and a kudurru is an inscribed stone deed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar was the oldest son and successor of Nabopolassar. Nabopolassar ended Babylons dependence on Assyria and left Nineveh in ruins. He married Amytis of Media, granddaughter or daughter of Cyaxares, king of the Medes. Thusly, the Median and Babylonian dynasties were one. Necho II, king of Egypt, gained victory at Carchemish over the Assyrians. The remaining Assyrian provinces were divided amongst Babylon and Media. Nabopolassar was intent on reconquering Necho. In the Battle of Carchemish, the Egyptians were defeated and Syria and Phoenicia were Babylonian. In 605 BC, Nabopolassar died, and Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the defeats of the Cimmerians and Scythians, Nebuchadnezzars campaigns were directed westward. The only power that wasnt west was the Medians. A political marriage between Amuhia, daughter of the Median king, ensured a lasting peace between the Babylonians and Medians. Nebuchadnezzar wanted to increase Babylonian influence in Syria and Judah. However, rebellions in the states of Levant caused setbacks. Nebuchadnezzar dealt with these rebellions and captured Jerusalem. In 587 BC, another siege on Jerusalem leads to the destruction of the city, Temple, and deportation of important citizens. After the destruction of the temple, Nebuchadnezzar began a thirteen year long siege of Tyre, which ended in the Tyrians accepting Babylonian authority. After he completed his job in Phoenicia, Nebuchadnezzar began to punish the Egyptians.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar was not only proud of his victories, but his buildings. Babylon was greatly devastated by the Assyrian kings Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal. Nebuchadnezzar had a goal of making Babylon one of the worlds wonders. Old temples were restored, edifices erected to many gods, completion of the palace, and more. Nebuchadnezzar did so much work, there is not a place in all of Babylon where one wouldnt find his name, or a trace of his greatness. Nebuchadnezzar built the Hanging Gardens to remind his wife Amytis of her homeland in Media.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nebuchadnezzar, in the second year of his reign, had dreams to erect a large image of himself made of various materials. When three Jews refuse to take part in the building of one of these images, Nebuchadnezzar throws them into a furnace. Nebuchadnezzar has another dream of an immense tree. Nebuchadnezzar is humbled by God when he boasts of his achievements. Nebuchadnezzar then becomes insane, and lives like an animal for seven years. After this, his sanity and position is restored. Some scholars suggest that these stories are a mix of Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon.[PARAGRAPH:1]After his death in 562 BC, he was succeeded by his son Amel-Marduk. Amel-Marduk had a short reign of two years, and was succeeded by Neriglissar, who was succeeded by Nabonidus. Babylon fell under Cyrus the Great as the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia.</German>
