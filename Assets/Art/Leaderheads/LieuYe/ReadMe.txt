This leaderhead is a converted model from Atlantica Online (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantica_Online). Therefore, while slightly modifications of the models and artwork were made by me, I take no credit for both and all rights are with NDOORS Corporation.

This leaderhead uses Asoka animations. It's completely modular. All files in the zip-file are already put into the necessary folders, unzipping it directly in the Mods folder of BtS should result into a working mod. It has a polycount of about 10000 triangles. There are a noshader and a shader version included.
